## 🎯 Purpose

-The EdTech Dashboard is an analytical Power BI report that provides insights into course types, viewer preferences, instructor ratings, skills demand, and accessibility features.

-This tool is intended for:

-> EdTech companies → to expand their content strategy.

-> Business analysts & strategists → to study learner behavior and category-wise demand.

-> Content creators/instructors → to identify growth opportunities.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Data visualization & report creation

📂 Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation

🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated measures, averages, and conditional logic

📝 Data Modeling – Relationships across categories, subcategories, instructors, skills, and languages

📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for previews/screenshots

-To deliver a category-wise, interactive visual tool that:

-Identifies popular course types & subcategories

-Measures average views across category, subcategory, and language

-Reveals most taught & most in-demand skills

-Highlights top instructors by ratings

-Studies course duration vs engagement and subtitle accessibility impact

🔹 Walkthrough of Key Visuals
